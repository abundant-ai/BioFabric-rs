//! Intermediate build data passed between layout phases.
//!
//! In the Java implementation, `BuildData` (and its subclass `BuildDataImpl`)
//! is the primary carrier of state between the node-layout phase and the
//! edge-layout phase. It holds the network, the computed node ordering, shadow
//! generation flags, and any plugin-specific data (e.g., alignment metadata).
//!
//! This Rust equivalent (`LayoutBuildData`) serves the same role: it is
//! populated by the `NodeLayout`, then consumed by the `EdgeLayout`.

/// Created after the node-layout phase completes, this struct bundles

///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// 1. Build a `Network` (from I/O parsers)
/// 2. Optionally call `network.generate_shadows()` (see issue 5)
/// 3. Run `NodeLayout::layout_nodes()` to get a `Vec<NodeId>`
/// 4. Construct `LayoutBuildData::new(network, node_order, params)`
/// 5. Pass to `EdgeLayout::layout_edges_from_build_data()`
/// 6. Result: `NetworkLayout`
