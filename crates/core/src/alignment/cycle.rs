//! Alignment cycle and path detection.
//!
//! When an alignment is imperfect, following the mapping from G1→G2 and back
//! can reveal **cycles** (closed loops of misalignment) and **paths** (open
//! chains ending at unaligned nodes).
//!
//! ## The 9 Cases (from the Java implementation)
//!
//! The Java `AlignCycleLayout` classifies every alignment structure into
//! exactly one of 9 cases:
//!
//! | Case | Structure | Description |
//! |------|-----------|-------------|
//! | 1 | `b` | Correctly unaligned blue (G1-only) node |
//! | 2 | `r` | Correctly unaligned red (G2-only) node |
//! | 3 | `(p)` | Correctly aligned purple singleton (1-cycle) |
//! | 4 | `p` | Incorrectly aligned purple singleton path |
//! | 5 | `r → b` | Incorrect 2-node path (one red, one blue) |
//! | 6 | `r → p → … → p` | Incorrect path: red + N purple nodes |
//! | 7 | `p → … → p → b` | Incorrect path: N purple nodes + blue |
//! | 8 | `r → p → … → p → b` | Incorrect path: red + N purple + blue |
//! | 9 | `(p → … → p)` | Incorrect N-purple cycle (N > 1) |
//!
//! Cases 1–3 are **correct** alignments; cases 4–9 are **incorrect**.
//! A perfect (reference) alignment is required to distinguish case 3
//! (correct singleton) from case 4 (incorrect singleton).

    ///    alignment to translate G2 names back to G1 names.

    ///    - Forward: G1_a → G2_b (from alignment)
    ///    - Reverse: G2_b → G1_c (inverted alignment, or from perfect)
    ///
    /// 3. **Trace chains**: For each unvisited G1 node, follow:
    ///    ```text
    ///    G1_a → G2_b → G1_c → G2_d → …
    ///    ```
